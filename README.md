# Data Analytics Customer Segmentation

The aim of this project is to carry out a Customer Segmentation Analysis for an Automobile bike Company.

The customer segment was divided into 11 groups for this analysis. The goal is to identify the targeted customer segments to boost sales revenue. Additionally, a Sales Dashboard for Customer Segmentation is created with Tableau, and data quality assessment and analysis are conducted using.

# RFM analysis
RFM(Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis is a method of analyzing customer data used to classify and evaluate the value of customers based on three main factors:

## 1. Recency:
Recency measures the time since a customer's most recent transaction.
Customers with higher recency are often considered more valuable as they have made purchases more recently and are more likely to continue purchasing in the future.
## 2. Frequency:
Frequency measures how often a customer has made purchases or completed transactions within a certain period of time.
Customers with higher frequency are seen as more loyal and have a higher potential for long-term profitability.
## 3. Monetary:
Monetary measures the amount of money a customer has spent within a certain period of time.
Customers with higher monetary values are considered more valuable as they contribute a larger amount of revenue to the business.

==> Value Assessment: Evaluate the value of each customer segment and develop marketing strategies and services tailored to each segment.
RFM analysis helps businesses gain a deeper understanding of customer purchasing behavior and enables the development of more effective marketing strategies by focusing on optimizing interactions with different customer segments. \
In this stage of analysis the customer segmentation was done by developing an RFM Model. The RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis is a behavior-based approach grouping customers into segments. It groups the customers on the basis of their previous purchase transactions. In this analysis the customer segment was divided into 11 groups. The groups being :

  Platinum Customers \
  Very Loyal Customers \

  Lost Customers \
  Losing Customers \
